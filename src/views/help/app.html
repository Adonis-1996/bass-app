    In the <b>Section mode</b>, Barline has several options for navigation and configuration within selected section.
    When a section contains more bars than can fit to the screen, you can horizontally scroll with whole editor workspace
    by swipe gestures on Barline area (use mouse on non-touch screens). You can also use <em>Pagination Controls</em>,
    which are useful especially for quick scrolling over large distances.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Beats per Screen</b> is another very useful option that you can control with mouse - by scrolling with mouse wheel
    (cursor must be inside Barline area). Alternatively, you can also set this option in <em>Section Preferences</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each project (composition) in this application should be composed from several smaller blocks called <b>Sections</b>.
    Every section can have different bpm (tempo), time signature, length and few other settings. With the exception of bpm,
    all these settings can be set in <em>Section Preferences</em> menu.
