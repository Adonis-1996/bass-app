    Some playling techniques like Hammer-On and Pull-Off require smooth transition from one note into the other one.
    On the bass guitar it means playing two or more notes on single string pluck/stroke. Another reason to connect multiple
    sounds is a Tie notation, where two or more notes are joined and played together with the time values summed.
