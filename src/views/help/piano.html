  <p>
    Piano editor use similar drag & drop and resize operation for creating notes. Main difference is possibility to move/copy selected note to any other key position, thus changing the note pitch.
    This feature is very useful for creating chord sounds, especially with several tied notes -
    create tied notes in one key and then copy them with single drag & drop to other key(s).
