### Project support

This application is free to use with all its features. There is a plan for the future to provide
some extra services oriented more toward content (lessons, covers) and support, that will hopefully
ensure sufficient financial resources to keep this project alive - implementation of new features,
bug-fixing, dedicated version for mobile devices, ...

If you would like to support this project directly, you can use [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/MarcelDancak).
